# Make Changes and Commit Locally

## Objective:
Learn how to make changes to a file in your local repository and commit them.

## Steps:
1. Open the cloned repository folder on your computer.
2. Create or edit a file (e.g., `hello.txt`) using any text editor.
3. Add some content to `hello.txt` (e.g., `Hello, GitHub!`).
4. Open Git Bash or terminal in the repository directory.
5. Stage the changes using the command:
    ```bash
    git add hello.txt
    ```
6. Commit your changes with a message:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Added hello.txt"
    ```

## Outcome:
Your changes are committed locally.
