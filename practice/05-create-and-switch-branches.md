# Create and Switch Branches

## Objective:
Understand how to work with branches to make isolated changes.

## Steps:
1. Create a new branch using:
    ```bash
    git branch new-feature
    ```
2. Switch to the new branch:
    ```bash
    git checkout new-feature
    ```
3. Make some changes (e.g., edit `hello.txt`).
4. Stage and commit the changes:
    ```bash
    git add hello.txt
    git commit -m "Edited hello.txt in new-feature branch"
    ```

## Outcome:
You've created and worked on a new branch.
